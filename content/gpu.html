                    In the field of making powerful processors, two things comies to our mind one is <span class="term">Central Processing Units (CPUs)</span> and <span class="term">Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)</span>. Where
                    the CPU came in late 1950s where on the other hand the GPUs came in 1999, GPU has emerged as strong contender against the CPU, originally designed for rendering the videos/graphics but today GPU has so evolved that now its
                    been use in complex calculations, simulations, gamming, machine learning and deep learning, covering almost all the task that CPU does. In this blog we are going to dive into the fundamental concepts of CPUs and GPUs, its architecture
                    from the surface level only, how they are different from each other and their unique strength and weakness, their use cases in different field and help you understand which one might be the best fit for your specific needs.

                <h1>Why It Matters?</h1>
                <p>
                    As the technology evolves, the lines between the traditional CPU and GPU roles are blurring. From gaming and deep learning to scientific simulations
                    and financial modeling, understanding the capabilities and applications of these processors is more important than ever. Whether you're tech enthusiast,
                    a professinal in the field, or just curious about the inner workings of your computer, this guide will provide you with valuable insights into the ever-evolving
                    battle of GPUs vs CPUs.

                        In todays world, we can't imagine our life without processors. We use processors in our day to day lifes from TV to Phones and Phones to Super Computer. Now I'm writing this blog on my laptop and laptop runs when processors do their job,
                        understading processors specifically CPUs and GPUs becomes crucial to understand its behaviour how data is processed and how memory is allocated to a specific memory location. Big companies like <span class="term">Intel</span>, <span class="term">AMD</span>,
                        <span class="term">NVIDIA</span>, <span class="term">Qualcomm</span>, etc. puting their Billions of $ in this area and fighting for their existance in the market and delivering high end processors to their customers like us.

                        A good processor is determined by its processing power, cost, price, power consumptionm, and efficiency. A good and a bad processor can have 5ms-10ms of margin. Means that if both processor 'A' and 'B' build by the different companies or the same company with same cost
                        ,selling in the same price and have same power consumption (idealy) but different processing power(model). If 'A' and 'B' do the same task where 'B' complete that task 5ms faster than 'A', then the processor 'B' will be the best, if the price of 'B' is twice the pice of 'A' then the 'A' would be the better
                        option(depends on your budget) even though it is not as efficient as the 'B'.

                        As of now when I'm writing this statement, I've Nvidia GPU GeForce RTX 2050 which is a RTX 20 series even though RTX 4090 is there in the market which is the best GPU as compare to RTX 2050 for doing task like gaming and computations like machine learning and deep learning,
                        fast and more efficiently and time saving. I believe that the RTX 2050 is good enough. You can play decent games and perform AI tasks with it.
