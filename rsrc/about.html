            Hey everyone, I'm <span class="name">Sahil Rajwar</span>, an aspiring engineer who works on kernels, algorithms, and learn n-nets.
            I also manage this webpage and write blogs, so it may take some time to post new content.
            Please bear with me.
        </p>
        <p>
            and I hope you will enjoy my blogs and find them helpful :)
